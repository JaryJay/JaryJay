# Hi, I‚Äôm Jay!

I love developing games üéÆ, creating desktop apps üìä, making websites üåê, and getting lots of green squares in my GitHub contribution graph.

I am skilled at Godot ü§ñ, Java ‚òï, Go, Python, and several JavaScript frameworks, and I also have some experience with C++, Kotlin, Unity, and Unreal Engine.

Notable JavaScript frameworks/libraries that I've used include React, Vue, Angular, Electron

## Spring Dynasty

I'm currently working on a 6-player real-time-strategy game called [Spring Dynasty](https://github.com/JaryJay/spring-dynasty). It's built with Godot 4! It's also open-source, so please take a look :)
