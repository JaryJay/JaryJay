# Hi, I‚Äôm Jay!

I love developing games üéÆ, creating desktop apps üìä, creating websites üåê, and getting lots of green squares in my GitHub contribution graph. I'm a CS student at the University of Waterloo.

I've worked as a software engineering intern at ETHGlobal, LavaReach, and Nokia.

I am skilled at Godot ü§ñ, Java ‚òï, Go, Python, and several JavaScript frameworks.  I also have some experience with C++, Kotlin, Unity, and Unreal Engine.

## Chess Roguelike

I'm currently working on a [chess roguelike game](https://github.com/JaryJay/chess-roguelike)!. It's built with Godot 4! It's also open-source, so please take a look :)
