Hi, I’m @JaryJay!
</p>
<p>
I’m interested in making games and apps for Windows, Linux, and maybe Android (and perhaps Mac).
I use Java, but I also have a little bit of experience with C++ and Python.
</p>
<p>
I'm currently working on a game called Nomad Realms.
</p>
<p>
Some of its cool features include the following:
  
- Peer-to-peer networking
- Infinite world, procedural generation
- Interaction with the world through cards only
- Complex card mechanics
- ~~bad~~ NPC AI
- Particles!

</p>

You can reach me on Gmail (jay.jrjren@gmail.com), Discord (JaryJay#8185), and LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-yuan-ren-107892211/). I prefer Discord.
