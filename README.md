# Hi, I’m Jay!

I love making games 🎮, apps 📊, and websites 🌐 (but mostly games, tbh).

I use Godot 🤖, Java ☕, Javascript, React, and Vue, but I also have a little bit of experience with C++, Python, and Kotlin.

## Nomad Realms Expeditions

I'm currently working on a game called Nomad Realms Expeditions. It's built with Godot 4.0! Unfortunately, it is not open source. However, if you want to contribute or just take a look, just DM me.

Some of its cool✨ features include the following:

- Cool 3D low-poly style
- Procedurally generated world🌳 using noise
- Complex card mechanics🃏 represented using abstract syntax trees
- ~~bad~~ NPC AI 🧙‍♂️
- Smooth camera movement
- Satisfying particles and other vfx
