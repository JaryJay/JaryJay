Hi, I’m @JaryJay!👋

I’m interested in making games 🎮 and apps for Windows, Linux, and maybe Android (and perhaps Mac).
I use Java 💻, but I also have a little bit of experience with C++, Python, and Kotlin.

I'm currently working on a game called Nomad Realms ⚔️. It's built with our very own game engine🎉, made with OpenGL and Java (to be more specific, it uses LWJGL's bindings of OpenGL).

Some of its cool features include the following:
  
- Peer-to-peer networking⚡
- Infinite world, procedural generation🌳 using OpenSimplexNoise
- Complex card mechanics🃏 represented using abstract syntax trees
- ~~bad~~ NPC AI 🧙‍♂️
- Particles!🎉

You can reach me on Gmail (jay.jrjren@gmail.com), Discord (JaryJay#8185), and LinkedIn (https://www.linkedin.com/in/jay-yuan-ren-107892211/). I prefer Discord.
