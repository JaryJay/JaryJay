Hi, I’m JaryJay!👋

I’m interested in making games 🎮 and apps for Windows, Linux, and maybe Android (and perhaps Mac).
I use Java 💻, Vue, and Javascript, but I also have a little bit of experience with C++, Python, and Kotlin.

## Nomad Realms

I'm currently working on a game called Nomad Realms ⚔️. It's built with our very own game engine🎉, made with OpenGL and Java. It uses OpenGL through [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/)'s bindings.

Some of its cool✨ features include the following:
  
- Peer-to-peer networking⚡
- Infinite world, procedural generation🌳 using OpenSimplexNoise
- Complex card mechanics🃏 represented using abstract syntax trees
- ~~bad~~ NPC AI 🧙‍♂️
- Particles!🎉

I've also made devlogs📸 documenting the process!! See my Youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodzqwvceoV2e9a_Nh8Zu1g).

## Check out my cool repositories!
The below repositories are listed in descending order of greatness:

1. [hermitrade](https://github.com/Dissonant101/hermitrade), an **ethereum-based** second-hand electronics marketplace made with **React**, **Typescript** and **Solidity**. This project, which I worked on with 3 other cool people, was made for JamHacks 2022, and it won **2 prizes**🏆!
2. [se-project](../../../se-project), a **skribbl.io clone** made in Processing that uses TCP sockets
3. [derealizer](https://github.com/virtual-cardboard/derealizer), a java **serialization** library built for our **LWJGL game engine**. I also made a **Vue interface** built with TailwindCSS 🍃 for generating serializable Java classes.
4. [jaryjay-sharnon](../../../jaryjay-sharnon), a command-line tool for managing **tabletop role playing games**, made in plain Java
5. [cellular-automata](../../../cellular-automata), a **plant growth** simulation made in Processing
6. [ClothSimulation](../../../ClothSimulation), a super clean cloth simulation made in Processing
7. [BoxHead](../../../BoxHead), a 2d top-down zombie shooter with **pathfinding**, made in -- you guessed it, Processing!

(The nomad realms repository is private, so there's no link to that)

(The game engine is also private, but I *might* make it public in the future🤞)
