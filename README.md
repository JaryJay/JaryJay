Hi, I’m JaryJay!👋

I’m interested in making games 🎮 and apps for Windows, Linux, and maybe Android (and perhaps Mac).
I use Java 💻, but I also have a little bit of experience with C++, Python, and Kotlin.

## Nomad Realms

I'm currently working on a game called Nomad Realms ⚔️. It's built with our very own game engine🎉, made with OpenGL and Java. It uses OpenGL through [LWJGL](https://www.lwjgl.org/)'s bindings.

Some of its cool✨ features include the following:
  
- Peer-to-peer networking⚡
- Infinite world, procedural generation🌳 using OpenSimplexNoise
- Complex card mechanics🃏 represented using abstract syntax trees
- ~~bad~~ NPC AI 🧙‍♂️
- Particles!🎉

I've also made devlogs📸 documenting the process!! See my Youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCodzqwvceoV2e9a_Nh8Zu1g).
